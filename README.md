# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

1. Implement a drag-and-drop functionality using React. The user should be able to drag an item from one list to another and vice versa.

2. Create a search bar component that filters a list of items based on user input. The component should update the list in real-time as the user types.

3. Build a pagination component that allows users to navigate through a large dataset by displaying a set number of items per page.

4. Create a virtualized list component that efficiently renders a large list of items by only rendering items that are currently visible in the viewport.

5. Implement a form validation library using React's context API. The library should allow developers to easily validate forms by defining validation rules and error messages.

6. Build a custom hook that tracks changes to a specific piece of state and automatically saves the changes to local storage.

7. Create a responsive carousel component that displays a set of images or cards in a carousel format that adjusts based on screen size.

8. Implement a reusable modal component that can be easily customized and styled to display different types of content.

9. Build a dynamic table component that allows users to sort, filter, and search through data. The table should also support pagination and be able to handle large datasets efficiently.

10. Create a multi-step form component that guides users through a series of steps, validating user input at each step before allowing the user to proceed to the next step.
